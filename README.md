### Frontend Development

#### Component Development

We follow a component-based architecture. Each component should:
- Be focused on a single responsibility
- Be reusable where possible
- Include proper TypeScript typing
- Have clear props documentation

Example component:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Card, Typography } from '@mui/material';

interface StatCardProps {
  title: string;
  value: string | number;
  change?: number;
  icon?: React.ReactNode;
}

export const StatCard: React.FC<StatCardProps> = ({ 
  title, 
  value, 
  change, 
  icon 
}) => {
  return (
    <Card sx={{ p: 2, height: '100%' }}>
      {icon && <div className="card-icon">{icon}</div>}
      <Typography variant="h6">{title}</Typography>
      <Typography variant="h4">{value}</Typography>
      {change !== undefined && (
        <Typography 
          color={change >= 0 ? 'success.main' : 'error.main'}
        >
          {change >= 0 ? '+' : ''}{change}%
        </Typography>
      )}
    </Card>
  );
};
```

#### State Management

For global state, we use Zustand. Example store:

```tsx
import { create } from 'zustand';

interface ThemeStore {
  mode: 'light' | 'dark';
  toggleMode: () => void;
}

export const useThemeStore = create<ThemeStore>((set) => ({
  mode: 'dark',
  toggleMode: () => set((state) => ({ 
    mode: state.mode === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light' 
  })),
}));
```

### Backend Development

#### API Endpoint Development

Follow RESTful principles when creating new endpoints:

```typescript
import { Request, Response } from 'express';
import { prisma } from '../lib/prisma';

// Get all trades for a user
export const getUserTrades = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  try {
    const userId = req.user.id;
    const trades = await prisma.trade.findMany({
      where: { userId },
      orderBy: { openTime: 'desc' },
    });
    
    return res.status(200).json(trades);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching trades:', error);
    return res.status(500).json({ 
      error: 'Failed to fetch trades' 
    });
  }
};
```

#### Database Schema Development

When extending the database schema, use Prisma migrations:

```bash
# Create a migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_trade_tags

# Apply migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Victory (`victory: ^37.3.6`)
Victory was a data visualization library for React that would have been used for creating interactive charts and graphs in the platform. It provides components for common charts like bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and pie charts. In our project, this functionality is now handled by Recharts and Lightweight-charts, which offer better performance for financial data visualization.

### Toolpad Core (`@toolpad/core: ^0.13.0`)
Toolpad Core is part of MUI's low-code internal tool building framework. It would have been used for creating admin dashboards or internal tools without writing much code. In our project, we've opted for a fully custom-built approach using Material UI components directly, giving us more flexibility and control over the user interface.
